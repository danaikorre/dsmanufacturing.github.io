# Assessment

This course is accredited; on successful completion you will receive a certificate that reflects 10 credits at Masters-level (SCQF Level 11). 

It therefore has a formal assessment component comprising
  * mini quizzes attached to key lecture topics
  * brief reflection exercises linked to the tutorials  <!-- [reflection exercises](reflection_exercises) linked to the tutorials -->  
  * a final project that enables you to answer, using your data visualisation choice, the challenge you define.

Your overall grade will be one of __Pass__ / __Fail__ / __Incomplete__

## General Submission Guidelines

1. Formal assessment must be submitted through Learn. Quizzes and assignments must be labelled using your student ID only (s followed by 7 numbers). If you have not been assigned a student ID please request a unique identifier from the course organisers to use instead. Please ensure you do not include any personally identifiable information on submissions as all work is marked anonymously. 
1. In-session exercises should be labelled with your student ID  (individual)  or group number, date and exercise number, and uploaded to the team channel for the tutorial in question. 

### Quizzes
 * Require selection from a multi-choice list and/or a brief written answer
 * For questions with a written component please provide brief answers. You may use one or a combination of 
   * a short paragraph, up to 5 lines, and ideally not more than 50 words
   * up to 5 bullet points
 
#### Grading &amp; feedback
 * Quizzes matched to a week's lecture topics will be released by the end of each week. At the start of the following week a standard set of solutions for free text questions will be made available, to guide discussions of quiz questions during the Q&A sessions.  
 * Quizzes are graded as complete/incomplete.
<br />

While we recommend completing quizzes on a weekly basis, you may choose to attempt them at any time during the course. **The final deadline for all quizzes is 23:59 on Jul 10th.**

### Assignments / Reflection exercises
 * Assignments are linked to tutorial sessions; while you are **NOT required to attend** these sessions **you MUST submit all assignments**. Guidelines for completing the exercises are detailed in the tutorial scripts, with summaries provided in the <a href="summaries_reflection_exercises">table</a> below. 

 * Submissions must contain ~200 and no more than 500 words, and fit on a single side of A4 paper
   * keep descriptions brief and to the point
   * use bulleted lists rather than prose to provide detail for key points
 * You may include diagrams, sketches and other visual annotations
   * please number figures referenced within text and further annotate sketches and any other diagrams as required
 <br />
  
 * You may submit reflection exercises using a non-traditional, visualisation-based method (rather than text-based), provided it communicates the information required effectively.

#### Submission deadlines, grading &amp; feedback
 * Assignments feed into completing your final project. Individual feedback will be structured to allow you to update the individual components of your final report. **You must submit assignments by the due date to receive individual feedback**. 
 * No penalty will be applied if you submit assignments after their due date. However, priority for providing feedback moves to the next assignment after each cutoff; unless you have obtained special dispensation you may not receive individual feedback in time to apply this to subsequent assignments and your final project.
<br />
 
**All assignments must be submitted by 23:59 on Jul 10th.**
