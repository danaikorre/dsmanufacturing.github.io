## What Am I Supposed To Do During a Week? 

Each week has a [topic](#course_organisation). All of that written below is optional, and serves as a guide to planning your work: 

* attend an open discussion and Q&A on the previous week's topic (usually for the first hour on Friday morning). We may also have guest speakers during this time. (~1h)
* attend the week's lecture (or watch the recording) usually at 10:00 on the Friday (~1h)
* participate in the workshop/tutorial in person and/or on **[Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3a-aesL4IX5XwKnSO79A5huVLtkWMnWwecRRObf7NBIuM1%40thread.tacv2/1643816881182?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%222e9f06b0-1669-4589-8789-10a06934dc61%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%2269a6ec46-60d9-4c4e-99e5-c8561f10dbfb%22%7d)** (2h). <!--There is a channel for each tutorial group A and B. --> Sessions are recorded (recordings will automatially appear in the channel);
<!--* submit the week's quizzes via Teams and check your answers against the sample solutions (provided after submission) (~1h) -->
* browse any recommended reading material (~1h)
* attend the Q&A sessions in the dedicated channel in person and/or on Teams. Q&A sessions are also recorded.
* any milestone assignments must be submitted through **[Learn VLE](https://www.learn.ed.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_6867286_1&course_id=_91471_1)**. 
* update your learning journal.

## Keeping a Learning Journal 

Students are expected to reflect upon their learning on a week by week basis. Learning can come from the lectures, from class discussions, from further reading, other assignments, talking with colleagues, business news etc.. The reflective learning journal is intended to consolidate learning and to help students consciously and intentionally develop Data Science skills. As Engineers, reflective writing might be new and a little bit confusing but there is a purpose for using it. Reflection has been shown to be a highly effective way of learning.

Your learning journal will be the basis on which we hold the discussion and Q&A each week.

This *[video](https://youtu.be/b1eEPp5VSIY)* gives a good overview of why to keep a learning journal. This *[paper](files/Integrating_Reflection_-_ASEE_2014_-_Final.pdf)* discusses the use of reflection in engineering education.

## [Assessment Guidelines](assessment.md)

<!-- In addition to the final project, the course has **three** assignments that need to be submitted to pass. Please note you **MUST** submit all [assignments](assessment.md) whether you attend tutorials or not. You must also attempt weekly quizzes. -->

## [Workshop/Tutorials](tutorials.md) 

Please read the [guidelines](tutorials.md) before attending your first interactive session; these take into account feedback from interaction with participants and the constraints inherent to a virtual classroom.
