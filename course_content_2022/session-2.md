# Tutorial: Design (Sketching)

Tutorial introduction [video on sketching](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19tveyPes-RNDs5KAX8whtvtzB0Uxre8M/view?usp=sharing) and [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PWUgxK7QhJ1C8ep91Sgu6NmWdAaBiY_N0t8apQ4MU2s/edit?usp=sharing).


1. Discussion 1 (10 + 20 min)
    * ***In the main classroom***
    * Quick review of project definition guidelines
    * Quick review of general design guidelines (from lecture material)
    <br />
    
    * ***On your own*** (5 min)
    * Draw four sketches 
         - today's weather
         - what comes to mind when you think of Scotland
         - this classroom
         - draw and annotate an idea of your own
    * Upload your sketches to your Teams tutorial channel 
    <br />
    
    * ***In the main classroom***
    * What things do you need to look out for in your design sketches?
       - similarities? differences?
       - visualisation types? abstract? concrete?
       - use of black & white? vs. colour?
       - what ideas came up in freestyle drawing? 
            - does this approach liberate or constrain you in coming up with ideas?
  

1. Activity 1 (30 min) <a name = "design_guidelines"></a> &ndash; _General Guidelines_
   * ***On your own***
    1. Go through your project definition and reflect on the key questions (~5 min)
          - What is the ___(Big) Question___?
          - What do you want to ___communicate___?
          - Who are you ___communicating___ it to?
          - What is the ___purpose___ of your visualisation?
    1. Based on your project definition and data think through potential solutions and sketch designs that illustrate these
          - for this initial exercise focus on what answers your question
               - do not restrict your design to what you already do or the skills you already possess
               - sketching allows you free reign to disentangle yourself from the restrictions of technology and skill/capability
          - the aim is to create sketches that communicate:
               * your design ideas to your intended target and other stakeholders
               * data content to your intended audience
                  - you may use multiple sketches to explore different options
                  - alternatively, you may have a single sketch broken down into sub-parts
    1. What are you communicating to your target users?
         - how are you communicating this?
         - does your design help your users to achieve their goals &mdash; the big question?
         - visualisation approach &ndash; how are you choosing to tell your story? e.g., using a data comic, one or more charts, infographic ...
         - what visualisation techniques will you include? standalone? coupled?
            - are you making use of visual metaphors? do they work for your target users and environment?
            - how will you present your design? structure vs. free flow? e.g., using a storyboard, a mind map, a flow chart, post-its on a board?
          - overview vs. detail, balance between complexity and sufficiency &ndash; remember the data-ink ratio
          - what pre-knowledge do you expect your users to feed into interpreting your visualisation?
          - layout and flow
               - how will users navigate through your solution?
               - where do they start? what support do you provide to help them discover the information they seek?
               - have you provided guides to help them correctly interpret the visualisation and confirm understanding (may include redundant encoding, legends, labelled axes, annotation)
          - aesthetics
               - visual appeal important but not a substitute for clear communication
               - colour palettes, use of patterns
          - static vs. interactive visualisation?
               - is your data dynamic?
               - do you need to visualise change or difference between data elements?
               - are you providing multiple layers?
          - do your users need to extract the underlying data? or summaries?
          - on-screen only? printable? mobile-friendly?  

   __NOTE: remember not to share sensitive data, especially when making annotations - your design need not refer to specific data__<br /><br />

1. Discussion 2 (20 min)
    * ***Within your groups***
    * Discuss your design ideas (choose 1 key area each and allow the opportunity for each person to share their ideas)
    * Solicit and give feedback
    * Nominate one idea or set of related ideas to discuss in class (3 min / group)

1. Activity 2 (15 min)
    * Reflect on general discussion and more specific feedback
         - update your initial ideas as desired
    * Now consider more practical considerations that may impact what of your design you can deliver now
        * do you have the data to build on your design?
            - what additional data processing may be necessary?
            - what additional domain knowledge will you need? do you have access to the experts required?
        * what additional skills will you need to develop?
        * note any practical constraints you envisage, e.g., (course) length and other resources needed to build solution, including technical skills, target user context and capability
            - what are the key elements you want to focus on for implementation - what is often described as the MVP (minimum viable product)?
            - what can be set as future work, that will further enhance your initial delivery?

1. Discussion 3 (20 min)
    * ***In the main classroom***
    - Round table discussion
    - General class feedback
    - Brief summary of reflection exercise, submission requirements and due date
   <br />    

___Before submission &ndash; reflect on your design choices by revisiting especially point (iii) in the [guidelines](#design_guidelines) for this exercise___
