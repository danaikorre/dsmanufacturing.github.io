# Tutorial: Tool Marketplace 

__This tutorial explores the <a href="https://vistools.net">VisBrowser</a> as part of a wider tool discussion__

1. Discussion 1 (20 mins)
  * ***Within your groups***
  * Which visualisation tools do you know and have you used? 
  * Which tools does the VisBrowser contain:
    * that you have used before?
    * that are new to you but map to your experience &ndash; technique type, visualisation approach, design, etc.
    
  * What do you see as the most positive things vs. cons in tools you use now or have used in the past? 
  
  * Can you think of a tool you think should be listed in the VisBrowser that isn't?
    * please add an entry for it (to avoid duplication designate one scribe per group)
    * include a review to the tool you have experience with. Everyone in the group who has experience of the tool may submit an independent review and rating
    * link to any good tutorials for the tools you add or others you look at that you have used or have been recommended. 
    
  * Prepare a brief presentation (3min &ndash; tool matrix + 1 slide listing pros vs cons) 
  * Nominate 1 or 2 people to discuss your selected tool  with 'novices'.
<br />

2. Discussion 2 (20 mins)
  * ***Main classroom***
  * round table discussion and presentation  
    * tool matrix, pros/cons 
     
  * which tools did you add to the browser?
  * which new tools did you find on the VisBrowser?
  * what guided your approach to rating tools in the VisBrowser? How did this differ from others in your group?
<br />

3. Discussion 3 (25 + 25 mins)
  * ***Within your chosen interest groups***
  * try out tools and resources that match your interests and/or learning goals
    * document pros &amp; cons, considering both functionality available and user experience
    * for your preferred tool search for similar tools  
      * what criteria do you see as important in your similarity search?  
      * does the VisBrowser's results match your requirements?  
      
  * how useful are the learning resources, if any, available for your choices?
  * how do you typically learn how to use a new tool? 
<br />

4. Discussion 4 (5-10 mins) 
  * ***In the main classroom***
  * reflect on how you would typically go about selecting a visualisation tool for a specific task
    * do you tend to explore tools other than those you normally use?
    * are you influenced in your choices by recommendations from people you know?
    * are you influenced in your choices by recommendations from resources such as the visBrowser?
  
    * what do you see as important criteria when choosing a tool? 
    * when trying a new tool, are you influenced by the availability and quality of learning resources for the tool?
