**Matthew Brehmer, Tableau Research, Seattle, WA**

**Thu, July, 2nd**

**Abstract:** This presentation will provide an overview of interactive visualization tools. The overview will consider tools used in practice, recent prototype tools from the visualization research community, and promising directions for future visualization tools based on current research trends. The presentation will also feature three lessons pertaining to multi-tool workflows, distinguishing chart-pickers from bespoke visualization specification tools, and the distinction between visualization authoring and visualization design.

**Bio:** I am a research scientist with Tableau Research in Seattle, where I focus on information visualization. Specifically, I am interested in expressive visualization design for communication and presentation, visualization design for devices large and small, and the visualization of time-oriented data, including quantities, event sequences, and dynamic networks.

## Facilitating Well-Informed Data Science through Interactive Visual Analysis
**Cagatay Turkay, University of York, UK**

**Tue, July 7th, 3:30pm**


**Abstract:** In this talk, I will talk about how interactive visualisations that are coupled tightly with algorithms offer effective methods in conducting data science in rigorous and critical ways. Such methods not only enhance the insights drawn but also support better informed decisions made based on the outcomes. We will discuss how visualisation can facilitate such practices and will look at examples of research on how data can be transformed and visualised creatively in multiple perspectives, on how comparisons can be made within different models, parameters, and within local and global solutions, and on how interaction is an enabler for such processes.

**Bio:** Cagatay Turkay is an Associate Professor at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies at the University of Warwick, UK. His research investigates the interactions between data, algorithms
 and people, and explores the role of interactive visualisation and other interaction mediums such as natural language at this intersection. He designs techniques and algorithms that are sensitive to their users in various decision-making scenarios involving primarily high-dimensional and spatio-temporal phenomena, and develops methods to study how people work interactively with data and computed artefacts.

## Title: Visualizing Text
**Christopher Collins, Ontario Tech Institute, OT**

**Thu, July 9th, time tdb***


**Abstract:** 

**Bio:** I am an associate professor and Canada Research Chair in Linguistic Information Visualization at the Ontario Tech University (Ontario Tech), where I lead a lab of 10 students at various levels of study. My research focus is interdisciplinary, combining information visualization and human-computer interaction with natural language processing to address the challenges of linguistic information management and the problems of information overload. My publications, including the DocuBurst document content visualization system, have helped to open a new and thriving area of research in “Linguistic Visualization”. My work has been published in many venues, including the IEEE InfoVis, IEEE VAST, ACM ITS, EuroVis, and IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,  as well as featured in popular media such as the Toronto Star, New York Times Magazine, and CBC Radio.

I received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Toronto in 2010. I have collaborated with the Innovis group at the University of Calgary, the Visual Communications Lab at IBM’s TJ Watson Research Laboratory and was recently a visiting researcher at Stanford University’s Department of Computer Science. I maintain fruitful research collaborations with exciting companies, including my work with Ontario-based Quillsoft Ltd. on their iWordQ reading assistance mobile application.
