The Scottish Funding Council (SFC) is providing a number of fee waivers; people normally resident in Scotland or the rest of the EU (for at least 3 years) may qualify for funding &ndash; more detail on eligibility is available and [access to an assessment form](https://www.ed.ac.uk/bayes/about-us/our-work/education/workforce-development/eligibility-funding).
Waivers are granted on a first-come. While the funding cap has not yet been reached, we suggest you apply for assessment as soon as you decide to take the course. 

Applications are currently being processed; if you meet the basic requirements and have not yet received a response for an application for assessment you should receive one in due course. You may complete a course application in the meantime &ndash; please note this in the funding section and the applications will be linked.

## Completing course application form

A single [form](https://www.ed.ac.uk/bayes/about-us/our-work/education/workforce-development/how-to-apply) is in use for a set of courses within the Bayes Centre's *Data Skills Workforce Development* portfolio; the form must therefore satisfy all courses' requirements and also the University of Edinburgh's formal requirements for applications. Bearing in mind that the data visualisation course has an atypical target student group, we highlight mandatory sections and where our requirements may differ from the standard, and provide answers to common questions from applicants. Please [e-mail us](mailto:datavisonline@gmail.com) if you have any other questions. 

Guidelines follow on how to fill in the University's application form. 

### Starting data

Please provide a brief summary, describing how you qualify to take the course &ndash; the form provides some detail about what is required here.


### Sections 5&ndash; Qualifications &amp; 6&ndash; Employment

Because is is accredited, the university requires evidence that you are qualified to take the course. Please provide information on either academic or professional qualifications:

1. evidence of completion of a university degree, using copies of certificates or transcripts or links to institutions that generate formal verfication of your degree. Please note that *ANY* university degree is acceptable; we do *NOT* require applicants to have a technical or computer-related degree. 
If you do not have a degree or other tertiary qualification please enter ***N/A*** for this section. 

2. a CV detailing professional experience. As above, this may be in *ANY* domain or sector. Please note that your professional experience overall, beyond school, rather than current employment status, is what is of relevance to this application. We have interest registered by professionals across a wide range of sectors, educational backgrounds, in paid, unpaid and out of employment; we anticipate each will bring their experience in life and at work to enrich learning during hands-on sessions. 


### Section 7&ndash; Finance

If you have made an application for a fee waiver please state this. If you used a different e-mail from that for this application please provide that here so that the two applications may be linked. 
If you meet the [eligibility requirements for a waiver](https://www.ed.ac.uk/bayes/about-us/our-work/education/workforce-development/eligibility-funding) but have not yet applied for one please indicate here whether or not you wish to be considered for one. 

If you do NOT qualify for a waiver please [e-mail Bayes](mailto:bayes-training@ed.ac.uk) for more information about paying for a place.


### Section 8&ndash; Referees

You may be required to provide a referee &ndash; this may be your current or a previous employer, a  colleague who knows you in a work or more informal capacity. While a formal letterhead is preferable, considering the restrictions of the current lockdown a reference by e-mail, preferably from an organisational address, that also states the working relationship with your referee may be submitted.  

If you provide a peer / colleague / personal referee please ask them to indicate in their reference understanding of your capability to take the course. This does not need to be explicit, but may refer, for example, to a working relationship, or mention capabilities or skills they have observed in their interaction with you, or relevant activities you have undertaken. Please note that such references do not have to be on a letterhead.

Please provide contact details including e-mail in this section; the University will send information on how to submit the reference directly to your referee.
