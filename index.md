# Course in Data Science for Manufacturing

![teaser](images/teaserdsm.png)

The [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk) is hosting, a university-certified, _10-credit_, online course in data science for manufacturing with flexible schedule. The course runs in 2022 from __February 04th - April 14th (10 weeks)__ and is dedicated to professionals in---among others---the manufacturing sector.

Assuming students are familiar with the processes commonly used to organise and undertake engineering manufacture this online course teaches:

*	What types of data can be found in manufacturing
*	How manufacturing data can be accessed, aggregated and analysed 
*	How the data can be used to optimize processes
*	Particular topics
    -   Python Coding and Notebook Programming Environments 
    -   Data Carpentry
    -   Data Visualization
    -   Relational and Graph Data Structures
    -   Forms of manufacturing data(e.g. Supply Chain (Supply Chain, ERP, PLM, CAD/CAM)
    -   Machine learning/Data analysis

It covers the fundamentals of: 
* Exploratory data analysis
* The importance of data science in manufacturing
* Tools for data analysis
* Tools and techniques for data visualisation and evaluation
* __Introduce__ you to the ramifications of data collection and use in a manufacturing setting
* __Introduce__ you to __programming__ with Python, version control with Git and Github and other key software practices.
* Develop an __understanding__ of data formats, their wrangling and management, including CSV and relational databases (SQL), CAD formats and materials 
* __Develop__ skills in the analysis and visualisation of a range of data using descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis
* __Criticise__ data use and practises 
* __Introduce__ collaborative practices around data collection, analysis and presentation

Class examples will include open-access data on a variety of relevant issues such as [Supply Chain Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/abdelrahmancae/supply-chain-analysis-and-modeling), [Process Monitoring](https://towardsdatascience.com/manufacturing-data-analytics-with-python-a-hands-on-example-6de8817a24dc) and [Process Optimisation](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-use-data-science-in-industrial-production-environments-6accf24afeb2).

### Learning Outcomes
1. **Understand** : Have knowledge of the data ecosystem of manufacturing companies
2. **Program** : Identify and deploy strategies for writing, understanding and managing computer programs using Python and version control.
3. **Data** : The ability to wrangle, analyse, learn from and visualise a range of data, in a way that demonstrates its relevance to digital manufacturing.
4. **Evaluation** : Critically reflect on the results and suggest constructive solutions. 
5. **Communicate** : Communicate around manufacture relevant issues, supported by the use of multiple data sources and appropriate analysis.
6. **Apply** : Competently apply data science techniques and tools.
7. **Professionalism** : Working in collaborative, interdisciplinary teams to a high professional standard.


### Takeaways 
* A **certificate** to reflect a 10 credit-bearing course at Masters level (SCQF Level 11)
* **Visual representation** of your dataset that enables you to answer the challenge you defined around it before and during the course.
* **Skills** to use data science effectively on manufacture related problems.
* **Communicate** your findings effectively.
