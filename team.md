      <b><!-- a href="bach.html" -->Andrew Sherlock, Prof<!-- /a -->,</b> is the Director of Data-driven Manufacturing at the National Manufacturing
Institute Scotland (NMIS) and Professor of Practice at the University of Strathclyde.
In 2006 he founded ShapeSpace Ltd, a spin-out from the University of Edinburgh, to commercialise
3D search-by-shape technology, initially developed as a 3D search engine for components and
subsequently enhanced to allow analysis of assemblies. This technology has been deployed at a
number of large manufacturers in automotive, aerospace and industrial equipment industries where
the ability to do analytics on component portfolios and large numbers of bills of materials has
uncovered significant cost savings within the supply chain.
In 2020 he founded EdAR (Software) Ltd another spin-out from the University of Edinburgh, applying
augmented reality to educational materials for engineering, medicine and other STEM subjects.
Between 2016 and 2019 he was the Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng) Visiting Professor in
Design for Product Profitability and from 2020 to 2021 as Industrial Chair of Data-driven
Manufacturing, both at the University of Edinburgh.
